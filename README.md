## CS210 Project 3 - Grocery Tracker

### Project Summary
This project reads a text file of grocery items, counts how many times each item appears, and displays totals and a histogram. It also saves results to a backup file.

### What I Did Well
I wrote clean and simple code using a map and short functions to keep it organized.

### Where I Could Improve
I could improve error handling for missing files or invalid inputs to make the program more reliable.

### Challenges
The hardest part was getting Visual Studio to find the input file. I fixed it by placing the text file in the x64/Debug folder.

### Transferable Skills
This project improved my understanding of file input/output, loops, and using maps in C++. These are skills I can use in data or programming projects.

### Code Quality
I kept the program readable and maintainable with comments, spacing, and meaningful variable names.
